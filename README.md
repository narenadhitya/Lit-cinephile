It is a movie recommendation project using multiple algorithms to get the best of the best results.

Progress board: 
 - exploring different algorithms to identify the best and most efficient models
 - found a code which already does this
 - identifying limitations in the current code - doesn't have user personalization - (only gives recommendations based on one movie chosen, not viewing history) - leads to better recommendation
 - working on it
