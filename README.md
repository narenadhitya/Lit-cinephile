# Movie_Recommendation_system


## Overview
this project is a movie recommendation system that combines multiple algorithms to provide personalized movie suggestions. The system utilizes content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, neural collaborative filtering, and gradient boosting techniques to generate accurate and diverse recommendations.

## Features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines multiple recommendation algorithms for improved accuracy and diversity.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Utilizes movie features and DistilBERT embeddings for semantic similarity.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements memory-efficient SVD for user-item interactions.
- **Neural Collaborative Filtering**: Employs a deep learning model for capturing complex user-item relationships.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Uses LightGBM for feature-based recommendations.
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Implements memory-efficient techniques for handling large datasets.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes functions to evaluate individual model contributions to recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive web interface for users to search and discover movies.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Generates recommendations on-the-fly based on user input.
